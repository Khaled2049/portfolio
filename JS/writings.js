const destiny = `<h4>Destiny</h4>
<p>
  The fate of our lives is not predetermined but created with time. I am a firm believer that we make
  our own destiny; it is not written down somewhere. There can be no doubt that life has a beginning and
  an end. I want to focus more on the journey (living) which is more important and far more interesting
  than the final destination (death). Along the way we learn things and make choices. We take actions
  based on the decisions we make which in turn make us who we are. I don’t believe that we have fixed
  destiny or a grand purpose in our lives. In the grand scheme of things, we are nothing but a spec but
  that does not mean our existence is meaningless. The universe is infinite and there are thousands of
  possibilities therefore, our destiny cannot be fixed but it connected with the fabric of the cosmos.
</p>
<p>
  A lot of things depend on the cards we were dealt at the start of our lives. A good childhood, a
  proper education and a strong will to not give up. The importance of strong morals and ethics cannot
  be overlooked. The significance of our teachers teaching us the “how’s” and “why’s” of life. Were we
  taught how to distinguish between good and evil? Were we taught to do the right thing without being
  selfish? Were we taught to be kind and honest? Furthermore, the most important quality, in my opinion
  is whether we have the ability to think. We need goals and objective and a mission in life. To be
  successful and happy we must not give into temptations of simple pleasures and be patient and think
  about the long term. All the while we must be aware, that nothing is fixed, and our mission will grow
  and evolve with us. The things that we find important will also mutate. But certain goals will remain
  same all throughout our lives.
</p>
<p>
  The relationship between family and the bonds between friends are crucial. There will always be up’s
  and downs but at the end of the day we need a safe place to come back to and unwind, the best place to
  do that is with those whom you trust. There are times when solitude is important, but humans are
  social creatures. Although, we need others we also need time to reflect by ourselves and to be alone
  because the answers to some questions can only be discovered by self-reflection.
</p>
<p>
  If I were to answer the question. What is your destiny? My answer would be simple. I have no clue. On
  the other hand, if somebody were to ask me what do you want your destiny to be? I would say that I
  want it to be someone that I can myself be proud of. I want it to be a story where I accomplish all my
  goals, have a loving family, and be successful. I want it to be where I have helped others living
  beings in some way and left something of value for future generations. I want it to be a life where I
  experienced many things and have my enjoyed my time. I want it to be so that I have not hurt others
  intentionally for my own selfish gains. I want my journey to be filled with hardship and struggle so
  that I can grow and become better. Most importantly, I want to make my parents to be proud and happy.
</p>
<p>
  What are my dreams? Most of dreams are meaningless and strange. When I close my eyes at night and go
  to sleep, I never dream about success or happiness. Most of the time my dreams are weird and random.
  For example, talking with animals or walking around and visiting nonexistent places. Therefore, I feel
  the question can be rephrased into something else like ‘What do you want to do in this life?’
</p>
<p>
  If I were to talk about my plan, about the things that I want to accomplish and do in this life than
  it would become a long and complicated answer. But there are a couple of things which I will divulge.
  I want to finish my undergraduate than get my masters because knowledge is important. Then I want to
  work hard and save money so that I can retire early and stop working for money. I will still work but
  my incentive will no longer be for money. I have no intention of becoming a rich man because money is
  a social construct and we can never buy true happiness. I want to run my own business and be my own
  boss, create something of value, and help those in need. I want to find someone whom I can respect and
  love, spend the rest of my life with and create a family. Have friends and family that I enjoy
  spending time with. Travelling the world isn’t something that is very important to me, but I wouldn’t
  mind visiting a couple of places every now and then. I will be happy as long as I am close to nature.
  Lastly, I want to teach others the things that I learn in this life so they themselves can live a life
  worth living and make their own destiny.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing will ever go perfectly according to plan, but we must be patient. Suffering is part of life
  the sooner we realize it the better of we will be. Sometimes we expect a lot from other people in our
  lives and then when they let us down, we become depressed and sad. We cannot control all the external
  factors in our lives so I believe it is best to keep our expectations low, but we must never lose hope
  because that would be giving up. We must try our best and even if we fail, we must keep trying to
  achieve our goals and make our “dreams” a reality. To create the destiny that we want we must be ready
  to make sacrifices. We must also realize that in the end the probability of our destiny being exactly
  how we imagined it to be is very low. Coming back to the point I made in the first paragraph the end
  is far less important than the journey. So even if our dreams and our imagined destiny isn’t exactly
  how we wanted it to be, it will be okay. We must accept It because it is all we have, and it is the
  best and only version we need.
